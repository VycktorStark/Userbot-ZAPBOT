## Getting Started

This is a project that will transform your user account or an alternative number into a bot account that will allow you to perform some functionality

Below, I am providing instructions for you to have a copy of the project, these instructions will show you how to get started using it for learning, development and testing purposes.

:warning: Note: This project is for learning, development and testing purposes. I am not responsible for any use for other purposes!

## Configuring the bot to run on the terminal

You must have your machine up to date and have Python 3 installed, as well as modules such as: selenium, if you don't have it, you will need to install it this way here:

```
# Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04 and 16.04, Debian 7, Linux Mint 17.2
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade   
$ sudo apt install python3 && python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install selenium
```
With everything installed,  we will clone the repository like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VycktorStark/Userbot-ZAPBOT.git

```

Well, now it is necessary to configure a single file, being "main.py", where you must add the name of a group or contact, this is part of the loop process that checks for new messages, it is necessary to inform a specific contact.

:warning: Note: the name must be the same as the name saved in your contact list

## Boot process

- To start the bot, run: sudo ./main.py
- To stop the bot, press Ctrl + C.
You can also start the bot with python3 main.py, to stop the bot, press Ctrl + C.
